== Description ==

Bucket List lets you create, organize and beautifully show off all the goals you have in life.

= Key Features =

Through an elegant and straight-forward administration interface, you can:

* Create as many goal categories and goals as you wish
* Smoothly organize, reorder and edit categories/goals without reload (AJAX)
* Mark a goal as achieved, and automatically register the date (you can as well modify the date)
* Link an achieved goal to an existing Post/Page in your blog
* Paste your Bucket List in any Post/Page using the [bucketlist] shortcode

= Widget =

We also included an optional widget that displays your latest achieved tasks. You can:

* Customize widget title (i.e. My Latest Achievements)
* Customize number of tasks displayed (5 by default)
* Set up a link to your complete Bucket List page (or any other page)
* Display or not the task category
* Display or not the date of achievement
